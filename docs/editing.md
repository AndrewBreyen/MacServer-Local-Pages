# Editing Local Pages

To edit local pages, the HTML needs to be updated on MacServer.

Make edits, and preview using MKDocs on a local machine. 

Once you are ready to publish, run `mkdocs build` to create HTML and other supporting files

Copy the contents of the generated `/site` folder to `Macintosh HD/Library/WebServer/Documents`, replacing all files

Refresh macserver.local page
